This is a personal playground for OpenGL. Fun side project to explore graphics programming. Builds on code developed for CGJ course at IST.

## Notable features

- [x] Scene graph
- [x] Basic camera controls
- [x] Blinn-Phong shading
- [x] Cel shading
- [x] Physically-based rendering
- [x] Image-based lighting
- [x] GLTF model loading (WIP)
- [ ] Shadow mapping
- [ ] Ambient occlusion
- [ ] Much more...

## Controls

- `WASD` to move the camera
- `Space` to move up
- `Left Ctrl` to move down
- Hold `Shift` to move faster
